Snooby: A Blackberry 10 Reddit Client
=====================================

Introducing [Snooby](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/23060906/), the very early 
stages of a Blackberry 10 Reddit client. Currently, Snooby is allows you to vote, comment and
check your mail.

##Philosphy
The philosphy of Snooby is to release early and often. New versions of Snooby will be submitted 
to the BlackBerry App World frequently with hopes of receiving feedback and letting its users
guide its development.

##Progress and Known Issues
Snooby is [open-source](http://github.com/achan/snooby) and its 
[issue tracking is also public](https://github.com/achan/snooby/issues?state=open). Development 
mainly happens on the [dev branch](https://github.com/achan/snooby/tree/dev) and 
[master](https://github.com/achan/snooby/tree/master) usually contains the latest released 
version.

##Road to 2.0
2.0 will be taking the [forcast.io approach](http://blog.forecast.io/its-not-a-web-app-its-an-app-you-install-from-the-web/):
*avoid replicating the default [BB10] styling and interactions.* The truth of the matter is that
Snooby is not a Cascades app. The more it tries to implement Cascades, the more its flaws will
show. By using my own UI, hopefully it will draw less and less comparisons to Cascades apps, which
I simply cannot emulate without writing it in Cascades.
